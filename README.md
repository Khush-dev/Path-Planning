# Path Planning Algorithms

Some basic implementation of A* Search Algorithm. The A_star_simple.cpp file is a graphical extension to the basic algorithm and requires simplecpp library.
Two different heuristics depending upon the allowed direction of motion are shown, mainly 
-Manhattan-Linear motion(4 directions allowed)
-Diagonal-Diagonal motion(8 directions allowed)
(It lags while making rectangles)

RRT and RRT* Algorithm is currently under testing phase.
Almost complete, UI needs attention.

Next: PRM Algorithm
